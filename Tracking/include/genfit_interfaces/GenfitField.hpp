/** @class GenfitField
 *
 *  Adapter class that provides a magnetic field interface compatible with GENFIT,
 *  using a `dd4hep::OverlayedField` as the underlying field source.
 *
 *  The `GenfitField` implements the `genfit::AbsBField` interface, allowing GENFIT to query
 *  the magnetic field vector at any point in space. It serves as a bridge between the DD4hep
 *  field service and the GENFIT tracking library.
 *
 *  Field values can be retrieved either as a full 3D vector (`TVector3`) or as individual
 *  components (`Bx`, `By`, `Bz`) at a given position. A convenience method is also provided
 *  to directly access the `Bz` component in kilogauss.
